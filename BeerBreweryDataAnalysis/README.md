# BeerBreweryDataAnalysis

## Project Overview

Welcome to the `BeerBreweryDataAnalysis` project! This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook focusing on a dataset from Kaggle. It's important to note that the data is generated and not reflective of real-world scenarios. This project is a personal exercise to apply and showcase my skills in data analysis and visualization.

## Data Source

- **Dataset**: The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and is a synthetic representation of beer and brewery information. It's crafted to simulate real-world data while being entirely generated for educational purposes.

## Analysis Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The notebook presents a thorough EDA, exploring various aspects of the dataset using visualization and statistical tools.
- **Statistical Techniques**: I have applied basic statistical theories, such as Chi-square, Pearson correlation, and ANOVA tests, to examine correlations and relationships within the data.
- **Visualization**: The project makes extensive use of data visualization techniques to bring the insights to life, making the analysis more intuitive and accessible.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy, SciPy (for statistical analysis)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to view the analysis.
